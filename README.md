This repository contains a minimal personal website built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It is served by a small Express server but can be hosted as a static site.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The site includes a short biography, links to example GitHub projects and a small gallery of artwork images.
